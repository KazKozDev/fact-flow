                    <strong>Fact Extraction:</strong> The text is first sent to a local AI model (Ollama with gemma3n:e4b) to identify and extract individual verifiable factual claims. The AI is instructed to break down complex sentences into simple, verifiable statements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Publication in the System:</strong> The extracted facts are published in the system for further processing. At this stage, the user can edit, delete, or add facts before verification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fact Verification via Internet Search:</strong> Each published fact is checked using internet search and then analyzed by AI to determine its accuracy. The AI provides a status, explanation, and confidence score.
